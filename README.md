Companion application for [LOOT](https://gilarpgs.itch.io/loot-qs)

Goals:
* Make remote play for LOOT easy
  * Database for tracking loot, pools, characters
    * Use JS localStorage for tracking state
    * Loot treated as constants
  * Barebones UI for GM and players
    * Simple HTML, JS to make deploying to GitHub Pages simple
* Maintain list of loot (quick start edition only)
